title: Working with web pages
---

After you made sure that the webserver is working, you can now edit the example code and change it however your want. 

Fiction comes with [TailwdindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) built-in. 

## HTML Structure
Fiction automatically wraps HTML-like output with `<html>` and `<body>` if it's not present.

You can use `<body>` or `<main>` for root component

```sh
function main() {
  @return html {
    <main>
      <p class="text-center text-5xl">
        My test page!
      </p>
    </main>
  }
}
```

For adding tags to `<head>` you can use `addMeta <tag>`, for example:

```sh
function main() {
  addMeta '<meta name="description" content="Generated by Fiction">'
  @return html {
    <main>
    ...
```
}
