Fiction uses most popular and pre-installed dependencies and has support for multiple cores for network. 

## Requirements 

- bash 4.0+ (4.* support in theory, not fully tested)
- GNU coreutils
- netcat/ncat/socat (optional, for HTTPS and fork support)
- awk, grep, sed (mostly preinstalled)

## Installation

<Steps>

1. Install Fiction by cloning the github directory

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/FictionWeb/framework
   ```

2. Go to the framework directory 

    ```sh 
    cd framework
    ```

3. Make `bashx` and `fiction` executable binaries

   ```sh
   ln -s $(pwd)/fiction.so.sh /usr/bin/fiction && chmod +x /usr/bin/fiction
   ln -s $(pwd)/modules/bashx /usr/bin/bashx && chmod +x /usr/bin/bashx
   ```

4. Start the server
  <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="fiction">
   ```sh 
   fiction run
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="bash">
   Fiction automatically loads and executes main file with bashx
   ```sh 
   bash index.shx
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="bashx">
   You can also use bashx directly to start the file
   ```sh 
   bashx index.shx
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

5. Check if the server is working
   Open `<server IP>:8080` in your browser; If you see the default page, Fiction is working and you can start editing the code in `index.shx` file.
