While Fiction is mainly focused on BashX, it has support for many other content types and routes

## Static content and HTML 
You can serve files content using [FictionServeFile](/reference/fictionservefile) function:

```bash
FictionServeFile "<file>" "<routeAlias?>" "<content type?>"
```

This function creates a route which points to function that returns file's contents with it's type

You can serve static HTML the same way by using text/html as content type

```bash
FictionServeFile "index.html" "/" "text/html"
FictionHttpServer "0.0.0.0:8080"
```

This code would show index.html as HTML (text/html) on root route (`/`)


## Directories
Fiction supports directory file listing using [FictionServeDir](/reference/fictionservedir)

Let's say we have directory `test`:

<FileTree>
- test/
  - test.txt
  - test.png
  - index.sh
</FileTree>


```bash
FictionServeDir "./test" "/files" false true
```

This would create following routes:
- `/files`: file tree of ./test
- `/files/test.txt`: contents of test.txt
- `/files/test.png`: image
- `/files/index.sh`: contents of index.sh
