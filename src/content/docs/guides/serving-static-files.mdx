title: Serving static content
---

While Fiction is mainly focused on BashX, it has support for many other content types and routes

## Static HTML 
You can serve static HTML pages using [FictionServeFile](/reference/FictionServeFile) function:

```sh
FictionServeFile "index.html" "/" "text/html"
```

This code would show index.html as HTML (text/html) on root route (`/`)
