title: Serving static content
---

While Fiction is mainly focused on BashX, it has support for many other content types and routes

## Static content and HTML 
You can serve files content using [FictionServeFile](/reference/FictionServeFile) function:

```sh
FictionServeFile "<file>" "<routeAlias?>" "<content type?>"
```

This function creates a route which points to function that returns file's contents with it's type

You can serve static HTML the same way by using text/html as content type

```sh
FictionServeFile "index.html" "/" "text/html"
FictionHttpServer "0.0.0.0:8080"
```

This code would show index.html as HTML (text/html) on root route (`/`)


## Directories
Fiction supports directory file listing and using `tree` ([FictionServeDir](/reference/FictionServeFile))
