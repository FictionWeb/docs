It's pointless to create a completely new concept of web in bash while there are other well-known implementations, for example [Bash On Steroids](https://github.com/tinoschroeter/bash_on_steroids)


Fiction supports CGI scripts and includes [FictionServeCGI](/reference/FictionServeCGI) function for CGI routes

## Using Bash On Steroids
<Steps>
1. Download Bash On Steroids and example index

   ```sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinoschroeter/bash_on_steroids/master/build.sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinoschroeter/bash_on_steroids/master/index.htsh
   ```

2. Run the builder

   ```sh
   bash build.sh
   ```
   This should create an index.cgi file in /usr/lib/cgi-bin

3. Add CGI route

   Open your main file (index.shx by default) and add simple HTML route:
   ```sh title="index.shx"
   FictionServeCGI "/usr/lib/cgi-bin/index.cgi" "/cgi" "text/html"
   ```

4. Start the server

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="fiction">
   ```sh 
   fiction run
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="bash">
   Fiction would automatically load and execute the main file with `bashx`
   ```sh 
   bash index.shx
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="bashx">
   You can also use bashx directly to start the file
   ```sh 
   bashx index.shx
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

5. Verify that it works
   Open your server's URL in the browser and add `/cgi` to open CGI route; For all CGI features visit [FictionServeCGI](/reference/FictionServeCGI)

</Steps>

## Using other CGI scripts
It's pretty straightforward, make your script executable 

```sh 
chmod +x /path/to/script
```

and add route:

```sh title="index.shx"
FictionServeCGI "/path/to/script" "/cgi" "text/html"
```
