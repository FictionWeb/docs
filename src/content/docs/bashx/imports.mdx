title: Imports
---

It's not a React nor JSX specific feature, but we also added `@import` with own features:

```
@import <file> 
OR
@import <file> as <functionName>
OR 
@import <function> from <file> [as <functionName>]
```

`@import` is made for importing bashx files, functions or any other bash file/function. 

If the file has `.shx` or `.bashx` file extension, it's evaluated with bashx, otherwise sourced with bash

You can also import specific bash/bashx functions from files and declare it with custon alias name; If the function is a wrapper, bashx would import both `Function` and `/Function`
```sh
@import Button from "ui/src/Button.shx" as MyButton
```

Importing a file with custom alias would create a function with file's contents
