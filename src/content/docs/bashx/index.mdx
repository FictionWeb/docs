The main problem with integrating any HTML into bash is, that there are no reliable syntax options for it. That's why we present BashX, followed by `.shx` and `.bashx` file extensions:

```sh
#!/bin/bashx
function main() {
  @return html {
    <main>
      <Component>
          hello world!
      </Component>
    </main>
  }
}
```

This is an example of using `@return` for HTML.

After that, we thought: Why not add JSON as well?
```sh
#!/bin/bashx
@return json { 
  "key": "$value"
}
```

BashX would generate `echo "{ \"key\": \"$value\" }"` and execute it. 


## Main concept of components
BashX has two main functions for component building and data parsing:

- @parse
- @wrapper

These functions build the whole system of components. 

```
  @return html {
    <main>
      <Component class='test'>
        <Component2 />
          hello world!
      </Component>
    </main>
  }
```

BashX will parse this code block and return as:
```sh
{ 
  echo '<main>'
  Component class='test'
  Component2
  echo "hello world!"
  /Component
  echo '<main>'
}
```

Any custom tag is parsed as function. It's worth mentioning that bashx has the same requirement for functions to have first letter capitalized.

Here is an example of `Component` function:

```sh
function Component() {
  @parse "$@"
  @return html {
    <div class="$class">
      {@children}
    </div>
  }
}
@wrapper Component
```

`@wrapper` doesn't do magic, it just splits `Component` with `{@children}` and creates function `/Component`


You can also see `@parse` function, which automatically parses all HTML-like arguments into variables. In our case, `class='test'` would store 'test' in variable $class.

## Semi-dynamic actions

`@parse` includes `on:*` and `js-on:*` events:

- `on:<event>=<command>`: creates Server Action with 'command' and saves `on<event>='serverAction(...)'`. It's generally made for all functions and commands
- `js-on:<event>=<domFunction>`: executes 'domFunction' and saves it's output as `on<event>='<output>'`. It's made for DOM functions and functions that return JavaScript code

```
@return html { 
  
}
```

Default `on<event>=...` events are just saved as they are. 

All events are saved in `$_events` variable, it depends on the developer, whether allow events or not.
